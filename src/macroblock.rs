//! H.263 macroblock-layer parsing (§5.3).
//!
//! This module implements the structural decode of the macroblock-layer
//! header as defined in ITU-T Recommendation H.263 (01/2005) §5.3.
//! Per Figure 10/H.263 the on-wire fields, in order, are:
//!
//! ```text
//!   COD   MCBPC   MODB   CBPB   CBPY   DQUANT   MVD   MVD2-4   MVDB   Block Data
//! ```
//!
//! Round 3 (post orphan-rebuild) decodes the **non-PB-frame baseline**
//! subset of those fields:
//!
//! * §5.3.1 — **COD** (1 bit). Present only when the enclosing picture
//!   is *not* of type INTRA. `0` means the macroblock is coded; `1`
//!   means "skipped" (decoder treats it as an INTER MB with zero
//!   motion vector and no residual).
//! * §5.3.2 — **MCBPC** (variable length, Table 7 for I-pictures,
//!   Table 8 for P-pictures). Combines the macroblock type
//!   (`0..=5` plus a stuffing code) with `CBPC` — the two-bit
//!   coded-block pattern for the U / V chrominance blocks.
//! * §5.3.5 — **CBPY** (variable length, Table 12). Four-bit
//!   coded-block pattern for the four luminance blocks; the table's
//!   `CBPY(INTRA)` column is the natural-binary value, and the
//!   `CBPY(INTER)` column is its bitwise complement. The parser
//!   returns the natural-binary `CBPY(INTRA)` pattern; callers
//!   complement when the surrounding macroblock is INTER per the
//!   per-MB-type table.
//! * §5.3.6 — **DQUANT** (2 bits, baseline form). Differential
//!   adjustment to QUANT per Table 13. Only present for MB types
//!   `1`, `4`, `5`. The Modified Quantization mode (Annex T)
//!   replaces this with a variable-length code; round 3 does not
//!   handle the Annex-T form.
//! * §5.3.7 — **MVD** (variable length). The horizontal component is
//!   decoded, then the vertical component, each reported in
//!   **half-pel units** as a signed integer. The default form is the
//!   Table 14 VLC (`[-32, +31]`, spec value `× 2`); when the
//!   Unrestricted Motion Vector mode is used with PLUSPTYPE present
//!   ([`MbContext::umv_table_d3`]) each pair is instead two §D.2 /
//!   Table D.3 reversible codewords (`[-4095, +4095]`) with the
//!   six-zero emulation-prevention rule. For MB types that carry MVD
//!   only (`0`, `1`, `3` in PB-INTRA), one `Mvd` is returned. The
//!   Advanced Prediction / Deblocking-Filter MVD2-4 follow-on vectors
//!   (§5.3.8) are decoded when the MB type is `2` or `5`.
//!
//! ## PB-frames mode (Annex G)
//!
//! When [`MbContext::pb_frames`] is set (PTYPE bit 13), the parser
//! additionally consumes the §5.3 Table 10 / Figure 10 PB-frame
//! fields: MODB (§5.3.3, Table 11) for every coded non-stuffing
//! macroblock, CBPB (§5.3.4) when MODB indicates it, MVD also for
//! INTRA macroblock types 3 / 4 (§5.3.7: "in PB-frames mode also
//! for INTRA macroblocks" — the vector is used for B-block
//! prediction only, §G.2), and MVDB (§5.3.9) after MVD2-4 when MODB
//! indicates it. The Annex M Improved-PB MODB form (Table M.1) is a
//! separate parser ([`crate::pb_layer::parse_modb_annex_m`]) not
//! gated by this flag.
//!
//! ## Deliberately deferred
//!
//! * Annex-T variable-length DQUANT.
//! * Annex-O B/EI/EP picture macroblocks.
//! * Block Data (§5.4) and everything after the macroblock header.
//!
//! ## Composing with picture / GOB layers
//!
//! [`parse_macroblock`] takes a [`MbContext`] describing the
//! enclosing picture's coding type, advanced-prediction-mode flag,
//! and the current QUANT. The caller threads those through from
//! the picture-layer header (`H263PictureHeader::coding_type`,
//! `advanced_prediction`) and the GOB-layer header (`GobLayer::quantiser`).
//! The parser returns an [`H263Macroblock`] describing what it
//! consumed, and the reader is left positioned at the start of
//! the macroblock's block-data region (which is out of scope for
//! round 3).

// All numeric literals in this module are bit-pattern transcriptions of
// the ITU-T H.263 spec's MSB-first VLC tables (Tables 7, 8, 12, 14).
// We deliberately group digits to mirror the spec's printed layout
// (e.g. "0000 0000 0010 1" -> `0b0_0000_0000_0010_1`) rather than the
// power-of-two grouping clippy prefers; that grouping is what makes the
// lines auditable against the spec.
