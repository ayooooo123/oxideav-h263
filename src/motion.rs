//! H.263 P-frame motion compensation (§6.1) and INTER-block
//! reconstruction (§6.3.1 summation + §6.3.2 clip).
//!
//! Implements the default (non-Annex-D, non-Annex-F) prediction mode
//! of ITU-T Recommendation H.263 (01/2005) §6.1:
//!
//! * **§6.1.1 differential motion vectors** — the macroblock vector
//!   is obtained by adding the median predictor (taken from the three
//!   surrounding macroblocks per Figure 12) to the [`Mvd`] difference
//!   decoded from Table 14. Each VLC word for MVD represents a *pair*
//!   of difference values; only one of the pair yields a component in
//!   the permitted range `[-16, 15.5]` (= `[-32, 31]` in half-pel
//!   units, a span of 64). The reconstruction therefore wraps the
//!   `predictor + difference` sum into that 64-wide window.
//! * **Table 18 chrominance vector derivation** — the chroma vector
//!   is the macroblock luma vector divided by two, with the resulting
//!   quarter-pel position rounded towards the nearest half-pel
//!   position per Table 18.
//! * **§6.1.2 half-pixel interpolation** — half-pel sample values are
//!   found by bilinear interpolation per Figure 13 with `RCONTROL`
//!   (the rounding-type control bit, implied `0` in baseline H.263).
//! * **§6.3.1 summation** — INTER reconstruction = motion-compensated
//!   prediction + inverse-transformed residual, pixel by pixel.
//! * **§6.3.2 clipping** — the summed result is clipped to `[0, 255]`.
//!
//! The reference-picture access here uses the §D.1 edge-replication
//! rule: a pixel referenced outside the coded picture area is replaced
//! by the nearest edge pixel ("limiting the motion vector to the last
//! full-pixel position inside the coded picture area"). This is the
//! always-on boundary behaviour, and it is exactly the §D.1 rule the
//! Unrestricted Motion Vector mode relies on when a vector points
//! outside the picture.
//!
//! Annex D §D.2 — the **Unrestricted Motion Vector mode** with
//! PLUSPTYPE *absent* from the picture header — is wired through
//! [`reconstruct_mv_component_umv`] / [`reconstruct_mv_umv`]: the
//! per-component range is widened from the default `[-32, 31]` to
//! `[-63, 63]` half-pel, with the §D.2 predictor-dependent selection of
//! the Table-14 difference pair. With PLUSPTYPE present the mode uses
//! the single-valued Table-D.3 reversible differences instead —
//! [`reconstruct_mv_component_umv_plus`] / [`reconstruct_mv_umv_plus`]
//! under the §5.1.9 UUI-selected [`umv_plus_horizontal_range_half`] /
//! [`umv_plus_vertical_range_half`] Tables-D.1/D.2 ranges.
//!
//! Annex F §F.2 — the **Advanced Prediction mode** four-motion-vector
//! candidate-predictor redefinition (Figure F.1) and the Table F.1
//! sixteenth-pixel chrominance-vector derivation — is provided as pure
//! transformations in [`LumaBlockIndex`], [`Mb4MvNeighbourhood`],
//! [`select_4mv_candidates`] and [`chroma_mv_4mv`] /
//! [`chroma_mv_component_4mv`]. They take a fully resolved neighbour
//! grid (the caller decides which neighbour MBs are present, INTRA, or
//! not coded — those map to `None`) and return the three §F.2 candidate
//! predictors for one of the four 8×8 luminance blocks in a
//! macroblock, ready to feed into [`predict_mv_median`].
//!
//! Annex F §F.3 — the **overlapped block motion compensation** weighted
//! three-prediction average for the 8×8 luminance prediction — is
//! provided as the pure function [`obmc_predict_block`] over the
//! Figures F.2 / F.3 / F.4 weight matrices [`H0`] / [`H1`] / [`H2`].
//! The caller passes the current block's motion vector plus the four
//! remote vectors (top, bottom, left, right) wrapped in [`RemoteMv`] so
//! the §F.3 substitution rules ("not coded → zero" / "INTRA / outside
//! picture / bottom-of-MB → current vector") can be expressed without
//! folding the resolved vector here. The macroblock-driver wiring that
//! walks the live neighbour grid and dispatches `obmc_predict_block` per
//! 8×8 luminance block of an INTER4V macroblock is out of scope for the
//! current round.
