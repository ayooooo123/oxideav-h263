//! H.263 picture decode driver (§4.2 / §5 / §6).
//!
//! This module wires the per-layer parsers
//! ([`crate::parse_picture_header`], [`crate::parse_gob_layer`],
//! [`crate::parse_macroblock`], [`crate::parse_block`]) and the
//! per-block reconstruction primitives (intra reconstruction §6.1–§6.3,
//! INTER motion compensation + summation §6.1.1 / §6.1.2 / §6.3.1, and
//! the Annex J §J.3 deblocking filter) into a *full-picture* decode.
//! The result is a decoded planar YUV 4:2:0 frame.
//!
//! ## Scope (the baseline single-MV path)
//!
//! Per §4.2.1 each picture is split into GOBs, scanned top-to-bottom;
//! each GOB header (§5.2) is followed by one or more rows of
//! macroblocks scanned left-to-right (§4.2.2 / Figure 4 / Figure 5).
//! For each of the picture's standardized source formats the number of
//! GOBs and the number of macroblock rows per GOB are fixed
//! ([`crate::H263SourceFormat::num_gobs`] /
//! [`crate::H263SourceFormat::mb_rows_per_gob`]).
//!
//! This driver decodes the **baseline** macroblock set:
//!
//! * **INTRA / INTRA+Q macroblocks** (MB types 3 / 4) — every block
//!   carries INTRADC (§5.4.1); AC presence is governed by CBPY (luma)
//!   and CBPC (chroma). Each block is reconstructed with
//!   [`crate::reconstruct_intra_block`].
//! * **INTER / INTER+Q macroblocks** (MB types 0 / 1) — a single
//!   motion vector per macroblock (§6.1.1). The MV is reconstructed
//!   from the §6.1.1 / Figure-12 median predictor (with the candidate
//!   border-decision rules implemented here) plus the Table-14 MVD,
//!   the luma blocks are motion-compensated from the reference frame
//!   ([`crate::motion::motion_compensate_block`]), the chroma blocks
//!   use the Table-18 derived chroma vector, and each block adds its
//!   IDCT residual via [`crate::reconstruct_inter_block_with_prediction`].
//! * **Skipped macroblocks** (COD = 1) — copied from the reference
//!   frame with a zero motion vector (§5.3.1).
//!
//! After all macroblocks are reconstructed, the Annex J §J.3
//! deblocking filter is applied to each plane *iff* the picture's
//! `J`-mode flag is requested by the caller (the baseline
//! non-extended-PTYPE header cannot signal Annex J on the wire, so the
//! caller passes the flag explicitly through [`DecodeOptions`]).
//!
//! ## Deliberately out of scope
//!
//! * **INTER4V / INTER4V+Q** (MB types 2 / 5) — four motion vectors
//!   per macroblock; the candidate-predictor redefinition lives in
//!   Annex F (§F.2 / Figure F.1) which is not yet wired. The driver
//!   returns [`Error::NotImplemented`] when it meets such a macroblock.
//! * **Annex T variable-length DQUANT**, **slice
//!   structured mode (Annex K)**, the Annex-I prediction
//!   reconstruction, and **GSTUF** auto-detection — all rejected /
//!   skipped exactly as the per-layer parsers do. **PB-frames**
//!   (Annex G) decode through the dedicated [`decode_pb_picture`]
//!   entry point (the single-frame entry points keep refusing them —
//!   they cannot return the B-picture); PB combined with Advanced
//!   Prediction is refused there pending the §G.2 OBMC remote-vector
//!   exception.
//! * **Custom picture formats** — the `"110"` source format (PLUSPTYPE
//!   path with CPFMT) lands via [`PictureLayout::for_custom_dimensions`]
//!   for spec-legal sizes that are macroblock-aligned (both luma
//!   dimensions divisible by 16) within the §4.2.1 range; the
//!   §4.2.1 / Table-4 `k`-parameter selects the GOB grid (`k=1` for
//!   <=400 lines, `k=2` for 404..=800, `k=4` for 804..=1152) and the
//!   bottom-most GOB is truncated when the height is not an integer
//!   multiple of `k * 16`. Spec-legal sizes that are 4-aligned but not
//!   16-aligned are refused (the per-macroblock raster needs a
//!   16-pixel grid). The reserved `"111"` baseline source-format code
//!   is the PLUSPTYPE escape and not itself a source format.

// Synthetic test bitstreams group bits to mirror the spec's printed
// MSB-first field layout (e.g. the 7-bit TCOEF ESCAPE prefix
// "0000 011") rather than clippy's power-of-two grouping, matching the
// convention in block.rs / macroblock.rs.
