//! H.263 block-layer parsing (§5.4).
//!
//! This module implements the structural decode of the block-layer
//! data as defined in ITU-T Recommendation H.263 (01/2005) §5.4.
//! Per Figure 11/H.263 each of the six blocks of a macroblock
//! comprises:
//!
//! ```text
//!   INTRADC   TCOEF   TCOEF   ...   TCOEF (LAST=1)
//! ```
//!
//! Round 4 (post orphan-rebuild) decodes the **non-PB-frame, non-Annex-T,
//! non-Annex-I baseline** subset of those fields:
//!
//! * §5.4.1 — **INTRADC** (8 bits, FLC). Present for *every* block of
//!   an INTRA macroblock (MB types 3 / 4). The 8-bit code maps to a
//!   reconstruction level per Table 15: codes `0000 0000` and
//!   `1000 0000` are forbidden, and code `1111 1111` represents
//!   reconstruction level 1024 (the slot where the natural-binary
//!   `1000 0000` would have been). All other codes `(code << 3)` give
//!   the reconstruction level.
//! * §5.4.2 — **TCOEF** (variable length, Table 16). 102 VLC
//!   code-points each followed by a single sign bit; one fall-through
//!   ESCAPE prefix (`0000 011`, 7 bits) followed by a fixed-length
//!   22-bit total event of `LAST (1 bit) || RUN (6 bits) || LEVEL
//!   (8 bits, signed two's-complement, codes `0000 0000` and
//!   `1000 0000` forbidden in baseline)`.
//!
//! TCOEF events are accumulated into a 64-entry `coefficients` array
//! laid out in **zigzag scan position order** (`coefficients[0]` is
//! the DC coefficient — for INTRA blocks this slot holds the decoded
//! INTRADC level pre-IDCT, scaled per Table 15 — `coefficients[63]`
//! is the bottom-right AC). The zigzag-to-block-position mapping
//! itself is defined by [`ZIGZAG_TO_BLOCK_POS`] below per Figure 14.
//! Round 4 stops at coefficient collection — dequantisation
//! (§6.2.1), zigzag-to-block placement (§6.2.3 / Figure 14),
//! and the inverse transform (§6.2.4) are all deferred.
//!
//! ## Deliberately deferred
//!
//! * §6.2.1 — Inverse quantisation. The coefficients we collect are
//!   the raw `LEVEL` integers from the bitstream, sign-applied but
//!   **not** scaled by QUANT. The dequantisation `|REC| = QUANT ·
//!   (2 · |LEVEL| + 1) [- 1 if QUANT even]` will be applied in a
//!   later round once we have a frame-yielding decoder.
//! * §6.2.3 — Block placement. The output array is in *zigzag scan
//!   position order*, not in 8×8 block layout. The caller can apply
//!   [`ZIGZAG_TO_BLOCK_POS`] to scatter into an 8×8 buffer.
//! * §6.2.4 — Inverse DCT.
//! * Annex I (Advanced INTRA Coding) — uses alternate scans and
//!   places INTRADC as a regular AC-coded value.
//! * Annex T (Modified Quantization) — extends the LEVEL field to
//!   allow the `1000 0000` code as an EXTENDED-ESCAPE prefix.
//! * PB-frames B-block data (§5.4 last paragraph + Annex G).
//!
//! ## Composing with macroblock layer
//!
//! [`parse_block`] takes a [`BlockContext`] describing whether the
//! block has an INTRADC prefix and whether any TCOEFs follow. The
//! caller derives those two booleans from the surrounding
//! macroblock's MB type (INTRA → INTRADC present) and the relevant
//! CBP bit (CBPY for luma blocks 1-4, CBPC for chrominance blocks
//! 5-6). The CBP bit's semantics per §5.3.2 + §5.3.5 are:
//!
//! * For INTER macroblocks — the CBP bit is `1` iff *any* coefficient
//!   is present in this block.
//! * For INTRA macroblocks — INTRADC is *always* present; the CBP
//!   bit only governs whether *additional* TCOEF (AC) coefficients
//!   follow the INTRADC.

// All numeric literals in this module are bit-pattern transcriptions
// of ITU-T H.263 Tables 15 and 16. Like macroblock.rs, we group
// digits to mirror the spec's printed MSB-first layout
// (e.g. "0000 1000 01s" → `0b0000_1000_01`) rather than the
// power-of-two grouping clippy prefers; that grouping is what makes
// the lines auditable against the spec.
