//! H.263 **forward** discrete cosine transform and forward quantisation
//! — the encode-side inverse of [`crate::idct`] (§6.2.4) and
//! [`crate::dequant`] (§6.2.1).
//!
//! The transform itself is non-normative on the encode side: the spec
//! (§6.2.4 / Annex A) only constrains the *inverse* transform's
//! accuracy. We use the exact orthonormal forward DCT, whose inverse
//! the decoder's integer IDCT approximates within Annex A, so an
//! unquantised forward → inverse round-trip reproduces the input block
//! to within that IDCT's rounding.
//!
//! ## Forward DCT (§6.2.4 inverse)
//!
//! The decoder's IDCT is the orthonormal kernel
//!
//! ```text
//!   f(x,y) = (1/4) Σ_u Σ_v C(u) C(v) F(u,v) cos(π(2x+1)u/16) cos(π(2y+1)v/16)
//! ```
//!
//! with `C(0) = 1/√2`, `C(k≠0) = 1`. The matching forward transform is
//!
//! ```text
//!   F(u,v) = (1/4) C(u) C(v) Σ_x Σ_y f(x,y) cos(π(2x+1)u/16) cos(π(2y+1)v/16)
//! ```
//!
//! which is the transpose/orthonormal dual; composing forward then
//! inverse is the identity (modulo float rounding), so a residual that
//! is quantised to zero reconstructs to zero and a residual that
//! survives quantisation reconstructs to its dequantised approximation.
//!
//! ## Forward quantisation (§6.2.1 inverse)
//!
//! §6.2.1 reconstructs a non-zero quantised LEVEL `L` to
//!
//! ```text
//!   |REC| = QUANT·(2|L|+1)        QUANT odd
//!   |REC| = QUANT·(2|L|+1) − 1    QUANT even
//! ```
//!
//! The forward direction is non-normative; we use the conventional
//! H.263-style dead-zone quantiser
//!
//! ```text
//!   |L| = floor(|F| / (2·QUANT))
//! ```
//!
//! which places the reconstruction levels symmetrically around the
//! transform value and maps small coefficients (`|F| < 2·QUANT`) to
//! zero (the dead zone). The INTRA DC coefficient bypasses this and is
//! handled by [`quantise_intradc`] against Table 15.
