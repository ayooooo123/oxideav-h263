//! H.263 PB-frame B-block layer field parsers (§5.3.3 / §5.3.4).
//!
//! The PB-frame mode (Annex G; signalled by PTYPE bit 13 in §5.1.3
//! or by the PLUSPTYPE picture-type code in §5.1.4.3) inserts two
//! additional macroblock-layer fields between MCBPC and CBPY:
//!
//! ```text
//!   COD   MCBPC   MODB   CBPB   CBPY   DQUANT   MVD   MVD2-4   MVDB   Block Data
//!                  ^^^^   ^^^^                                  ^^^^
//!                  §5.3.3 §5.3.4                                §5.3.9
//! ```
//!
//! This module provides the pure-parser primitives the macroblock
//! layer ([`crate::macroblock::parse_macroblock`] under
//! [`crate::macroblock::MbContext::pb_frames`]) consumes for them,
//! plus the §G.4 / §G.5 prediction primitives the PB-frame picture
//! driver ([`crate::picture::decode_pb_picture`]) composes:
//!
//! * [`parse_modb`] — §5.3.3 / Table 11 variable-length codeword that
//!   tells the decoder whether the B-block coefficient pattern (CBPB)
//!   and/or the B-block motion-vector difference (MVDB) are on the
//!   wire for the current macroblock. Returns a [`ModbPresence`] tag
//!   covering the three legal codewords; an unrecognised prefix is a
//!   bitstream error.
//! * [`parse_cbpb`] — §5.3.4 6-bit fixed-length field; bit `5` (MSB)
//!   carries B-block number 1, bit `0` (LSB) carries B-block number
//!   6. Returns the raw 6-bit pattern in the low bits of a `u8`.
//!   [`cbpb_block_present`] is the per-block accessor that consults
//!   the pattern with the Figure-5 / §5.3.4 "utmost left bit ↔ block
//!   number 1" convention.
//!
//! ## Composition with the macroblock driver
//!
//! These are pure-parser primitives. They do not consult any
//! enclosing-picture context (PTYPE / MCBPC MB-type / Annex M vs
//! Annex G mode-selector). The macroblock driver is responsible for
//! gating their invocation per §5.3.3 ("MODB is present for MB-type
//! 0-4 if PTYPE indicates 'PB-frame'") and §5.3.4 ("CBPB is only
//! present in PB-frames mode if indicated by MODB").
//!
//! The Annex M (Improved PB-frames) MODB table is **different** from
//! Table 11 — Annex M defines a 6-entry table (Table M.1) where the
//! Annex G [`parse_modb`] primitive covers only the 3-entry form.
//! [`parse_modb_annex_m`] is the sibling primitive for the Annex M
//! 6-entry form; it returns a [`ModbAnnexM`] tag combining the
//! `(CBPB, MVDB)` presence pair with the per-row coding mode
//! ([`BpbCodingMode`]) Table M.1 attaches to each row. The Annex M
//! "BPB" terminology (B-Part of an Improved PB-frame, per §M.1) is
//! used in the tag and its accessors; per §M.1 "B-picture, B-macroblock
//! and B-block will not be used in this annex".
//!
//! Per §5.3.9, MVDB is "a variable length codeword for the horizontal
//! component followed by a variable length codeword for the vertical
//! component of each vector. Variable length codes are given in
//! Table 14." Table 14 is the same MVD VLC the baseline §5.3.7 parser
//! already decodes via [`crate::macroblock::H263Macroblock::mvd`]'s
//! component decoder; no new VLC table lands for MVDB itself. The
//! macroblock driver wires the existing `decode_mvd_component` into
//! MVDB when MODB indicates MVDB presence.
//!
//! ## §G.4 — Calculation of vectors for the B-picture
//!
//! Once the §5.3.9 MVDB has been parsed (or determined absent from the
//! §5.3.3 / §M.4 MODB tag), §G.4 derives the per-luminance-block
//! forward and backward motion vectors `(MVF, MVB)` of the B-picture
//! from three inputs: the P-picture's vector `MV` for the 8×8 luma
//! block, the §5.3.9 delta `MVD` (zero if MVDB absent), and the
//! temporal-reference scalars `TRB` (§5.1.22) and `TRD` (the §5.1.2 TR
//! increment from the last picture header). The spec specifies the
//! pair via:
//!
//! ```text
//!   MVF = (TRB × MV) / TRD + MVD
//!   MVB = ((TRB - TRD) × MV) / TRD      if MVD == 0
//!   MVB = MVF - MV                      if MVD != 0
//! ```
//!
//! with "/" meaning division by truncation (Rust's signed-integer `/`
//! operator). Both `MVF` and `MVB` are returned in half-pel units;
//! [`pb_b_vectors`] computes one component pair (horizontal or
//! vertical), and [`pb_b_vector`] composes the two components into a
//! [`MotionVector`] pair for the full 8×8 luma block. §G.4 also
//! prescribes the chroma B-vector derivation: sum the four luma MVF
//! (resp. MVB) components and divide by 8, then snap toward the
//! nearest half-pel position per Table F.1 — the existing
//! [`crate::motion::chroma_mv_component_4mv`] / `chroma_mv_4mv`
//! primitive performs exactly that sum-of-4-luma-half-pel /
//! Table-F.1-snap transform, so [`pb_b_chroma_vector`] composes it
//! over the four luma B-vectors directly without duplicating the
//! Table F.1 logic.
//!
//! ## §G.5 — Bidirectional-prediction mask for a B-block
//!
//! §G.5 prescribes that, once the §G.4 vector pair `(MVF, MVB)` is
//! known, the per-pixel prediction of a B-block in a PB-frame splits
//! into two regions:
//!
//! * pixels where `MVB` points **inside** the just-reconstructed
//!   P-macroblock (PREC) are predicted bidirectionally — the average
//!   of the forward prediction (MVF, relative to the previous decoded
//!   picture) and the backward prediction (MVB, relative to PREC);
//!   the average is by truncation;
//! * all other pixels of the B-block are predicted by forward
//!   prediction only (MVF, relative to the previous decoded picture).
//!
//! §G.5 specifies the per-pixel split with two C-language loop nests
//! (one for luminance, one for chrominance), reproduced verbatim here
//! for cross-reference:
//!
//! ```text
//!   /* luminance: per 8 × 8 luma block (nh, nv) in the macroblock */
//!   for (nh = 0; nh <= 1; nh++) {
//!     for (nv = 0; nv <= 1; nv++) {
//!       for (i = nh*8 + max(0, (-mh(nh,nv)+1)/2 - nh*8);
//!            i <= nh*8 + min(7, 15 - (mh(nh,nv)+1)/2 - nh*8); i++) {
//!         for (j = nv*8 + max(0, (-mv(nh,nv)+1)/2 - nv*8);
//!              j <= nv*8 + min(7, 15 - (mv(nh,nv)+1)/2 - nv*8); j++) {
//!           predict pixel (i,j) bidirectionally
//!         }
//!       }
//!     }
//!   }
//!
//!   /* chrominance: one 8 × 8 chroma block per macroblock */
//!   for (i = max(0, (-mhc+1)/2); i <= min(7, 7 - (mhc+1)/2); i++) {
//!     for (j = max(0, (-mvc+1)/2); j <= min(7, 7 - (mvc+1)/2); j++) {
//!       predict pixel (i,j) bidirectionally;
//!     }
//!   }
//! ```
//!
//! Reading the two nests algebraically: per axis, the §G.5
//! bidirectional pixels of a luma block at (nh, nv) are those `i`
//! satisfying
//!
//! * `i ≥ nh*8` and `i ≥ (-mh+1)/2` (lower bound)
//! * `i ≤ nh*8 + 7` and `i ≤ 15 - (mh+1)/2` (upper bound)
//!
//! i.e. `i ∈ [max(nh*8, (-mh+1)/2), min(nh*8+7, 15 - (mh+1)/2)]` in
//! macroblock-local pixel coordinates 0..=15; the range is empty
//! when the lower bound exceeds the upper. For chrominance the
//! same shape applies inside a single 8 × 8 chroma block:
//! `i ∈ [max(0, (-mhc+1)/2), min(7, 7 - (mhc+1)/2)]` in 0..=7.
//!
//! "/" is integer division by truncation (matching Rust's signed
//! `/`). Per §G.5 each axis is independent — a pixel is
//! bidirectional if and only if **both** axes' ranges include its
//! coordinate. The mask thus factorises as the Cartesian product of
//! a horizontal and a vertical 1-D inclusive range, which is what the
//! primitives below return.
//!
//! [`pb_b_bidir_extent_component`] is the per-axis pure function: it
//! takes one half-pel `MVB` component and the inclusive `[lo, hi]`
//! block extent (`[0, 7]` for chroma or the nh=0 / nv=0 luma
//! sub-block, `[8, 15]` for nh=1 / nv=1) and returns the §G.5
//! inclusive range or `None` if empty. [`pb_b_bidir_luma_block_extent`]
//! composes it for one of the four 8 × 8 luma sub-blocks at
//! `(nh, nv)`, returning the 2-D rectangle of bidirectional pixels.
//! [`pb_b_bidir_chroma_extent`] is the chroma counterpart over the
//! single 0..=7 block. Pixels outside the returned rectangle are
//! forward-only per §G.5's "all other pixels" clause.
//!
//! The blend itself — the per-pixel arithmetic §G.5 prescribes for
//! pixels inside the rectangle — is [`pb_b_bidir_pixel`]: average
//! of the two prediction samples by integer division. The driver
//! convenience [`pb_b_blend_block`] applies the average across one
//! 8 × 8 block given the rectangle from an extent primitive and the
//! two prediction arrays, falling back to the forward sample for
//! pixels outside the rectangle.

///   (§4.2.3 macroblock grid). The chroma block position is
///   `(mb_x / 2, mb_y / 2)` per the §4.2 4:2:0 sampling layout.
/// * `p_mvs` — the four P-picture luma motion vectors `MV` in
///   Figure 5 block order (block 0 top-left, 1 top-right, 2
///   bottom-left, 3 bottom-right), half-pel units. Per §G.4: "if only

///   replicate the macroblock vector into all four entries. §G.4 also
///   covers INTRA P-macroblocks ("The formulae for MVF and MVB are
///   also used in the case of INTRA blocks where the vector data is
///   used only for predicting B-blocks") — the caller passes the
///   vector data decoded for that purpose.
/// * `mvd` — the §5.3.9 MVDB delta, or `None` when MODB signalled no
///   MVDB ("If MVDB is not present, MVD is set to zero", §G.4).
/// * `trb` / `trd` — the §G.4 temporal-reference scalars (see
